A couple of days ago Heroku [announced](http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2011/8/25/java/) support for Java on their servers. I took the opportunity to try and get a Sinatra app running on Heroku using the Java support to boostrap JRuby.

In Heroku's blog post they mentioned that Matthew Rodley had already put a Rails app on Heroku by simply adding JRuby to `pom.xml`. Looking at what Matthew had done it didn't seem to hard to get something working. First thing is to setup a simple Sinatra app.

```ruby
require "rubygems"
require "bundler"

Bundler.require

require "sinatra"

get "/" do
  "Hello World"
end
```

Nothing complicated there.

There are a few potential gotchas when working with Heroku though. From what I can tell if there is a `config.ru` or `Gemfile` present in the root application directory, Heroku will ignore the `pom.xml` and start the application using Ruby. I like Matthew's approach of renaming the `Gemfile` to `Jemfile`.

    source "http://rubygems.org"

    gem "sinatra"
    gem "trinidad"

The process of running a Java app on Heroku goes like this:

1. Heroku detects `pom.xml` and runs a `mvn install`. This should install any Java dependancies.
2. Heroku reads `Procfile` and executes `web` command.

Normally, the command that is in the Procfile is a script that is generated by the `maven-appassembler-plugin`. This script looks up the location of the JRE and sets the appropriate Java `classpath` so dependancies can be resolved when launching a Java application. The main difference with JRuby is what this script calls to launch our Ruby app. Rather than `java net.example.MyApp` we want something like `java org.jruby.Main -S trinidad -p 4567`.

Copying what Matthew did, I copied his script and placed in the `script` folder. Then I placed the following line in my `Procfile`.

    web: sh script/jruby -S trinidad -p $PORT

The script `jruby` is a slightly modified version of a startup script that get's generated by the `maven-appassembler-plugin`. Heroku will execute the above command when trying to start our app.

Lastly in our `pom.xml` we need to tell `maven` to pull down both JRuby and the JRuby rake plugin. JRuby also needs the gems that are required by our app. Again Matthew's `pom.xml` does all of this.

                </executions>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
</project>
```

The important part to note here is the in the plugins section. We're telling `maven` to execute a couple of commands so that the required gems get installed into JRuby. First it executes:

    jruby -S gem install bundler --no-ri --no-rdoc --install-dir .gems

This installs bundler. Then the following is executed to install the required gems.

    jruby -e ENV['GEM_HOME']=File.join(Dir.pwd,'.gems'); \
       ENV['GEM_PATH']=File.join(Dir.pwd,'.gems'); \
       ENV['BUNDLE_GEMFILE']=File.join(Dir.pwd,'Jemfile'); \
        require'rubygems'; \
        require'bundler'; \
        require'bundler/cli'; \
        cli=Bundler::CLI.new; \
        cli.install

Note that Gemfile is specified as the new name `Jemfile`.

To summarise, this is what occurs when a push is sent to Heroku:

1. Heroku detects `pom.xml` and runs `mvn install`.
2. `maven` reads `pom.xml` and does the following:
   - Gets JRuby
   - Installs the bundler gem using JRuby
   - Installs the required gems to `.gems` using JRuby.
3. Heroku inspects the `Procfile` and calls the `web` process that is defined.
4. `script/jruby -S trinidad -p <port>` is called.

There was one problem that occured with the `jruby` script though. I was getting class not found errors from Java and the application would fail to load. By default it seems the `REPO` environment variable is undefined. The script default value to set if `REPO` is unavailable is `$BASEDIR/repo`, but this evaluates to `app/repo`, which doesn't exist. `maven` installs dependancies to `.m2/repository` so I changed it to the following:

    if [ -z "$REPO" ]
    then
        REPO="$BASEDIR"/.m2/repository
    fi

I've put this test project on [GitHub](https://github.com/christohperjschow/sinatra-jruby-heroku) for those interested.
