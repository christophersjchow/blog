The [Jumba VPS'](http://www.jumba.com.au/vps) are a great affordable way to get
a VPS for testing and basic hosting. However, setting up a VPS is not easy and
I ran into a few road blocks getting Rails running on my server. I decided to
document what I did to get Rails running in the context of a Jumba VPS so that
others can get up and running, but also because I actually started to forget
what I had done.

## DNS Records

After purchasing a VPS (and a domain if you don't already have one) you'll need
to create an A record pointing to the IP of your VPS. You can manage your
domains with Jumba at their [domain management](http://domains.jumba.com.au)
page.

## Users and sudo

The default Ubuntu image that is given on Jumba's VPS is configured a little
differently from a standard Ubuntu install. This is specifically to do with the
handling of sudo. Ubuntu handles root privileges by disabling the root account
and giving users in the admin groups the ability to run tasks with root
permissions. However, the Jumba Ubuntu image doesn't have this group, has the
root account enabled (this is required for Parallels) and the corresponding
configuration in the `/etc/sudoers` file also doesn't reflect this. Let's
change this to regular Ubuntu behaviour.

First, SSH in as root and create the admin group. The group ID of `106` is
Ubuntu's default group ID for the admin group.

```sh
groupadd -g 106 admin
```

Next create a user for yourself and follow the prompts. Pick a reasonably
strong password, as that will be the password used with sudo (it won't be used
for SSH as we'll setup key authentication later).

```sh
adduser
```

Now add your user to the admin group.

```sh
adduser admin
```

Next the `/etc/sudoers` file needs to be edited.

```sh
visudo
```

Make sure this line `%sudo ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL` remains commented out. This line
allows users with sudo access to execute `sudo` without a password. This is bad
from a security standpoint so make sure it's commented out. Add the following
to the bottom of the file to enable sudo access to users in the admin group.

```sh
%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL
```

Now try to SSH into the machine with the newly created user account and
password.

## System Locale and NTP

We can now use sudo to run anything that is required as root. Let's update the
VPS and set the default locale.

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

Whilst I was setting up webmin (I'll get to that later) I ran into a locale
issue. The default locale is not setup on the Jumba VPS. First edit the
`/var/lib/locales/supported.d/local`. Create this if it doesn't exist and add
the following line, and any others that you wish to have enabled.

```sh
sudo vim /var/lib/locales/supported.d/local
en_AU UTF-8
```

Then run the following to generate the locales.

```sh
sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
```

Edit `/etc/default/locale` to setup your VPS' default locale.

```sh
sudo vim /etc/default/locale
LANG="en_AU:UTF-8"
```

Reboot the container and the locale should be correctly set.

Let's also install ntp to keep the time accurate.

```sh
sudo apt-get install ntp ntpdate
```

## SSH

An unsecure SSH daemon is probably the most common way a server gets rooted.
Locking down the SSH server is very important when running an unmanaged VPS so
it's strongly recommended that you do something similar. The following should
be a good starting point to getting SSH secure on _any_ VPS.

## Disable root logins

This is an obvious one, and I think anyone who has any experience with
administering a server would tell you to do this. There is no reason to login
as root as almost any task that needs to be run as root can be done via `sudo`.

To disable root logins edit the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file and add:

```
PermitRootLogin no
```

Reload the SSH daemon configuration by calling `sudo /etc/init.d/ssh reload`

## Key Authentication

Key authentication is an alternative to the traditional username and password
method of authentication. Rather than using a username and password, users can
create a matched private and public key pair. The public key resides on the
server and the private key is kept by the user. When ever an authentication
request is made the user must present his/her private key to the server.

To create a public/private key pair on Linux/OSX, run the following on your
local machine.

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

It's _strongly_ recommended you pick a paraphrase. This will create public and
private keys `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` and `~/.ssh/id_rsa`. Now, the public key needs
to be placed on the server. We can use the `scp` command to upload the public
key.

```sh
scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub username@yourdomain:.
```

Now SSH into your VPS and run the following to place your public key in the
appropriate place:

```sh
cat id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2
```

Logout of your VPS and try to SSH in again.

```
ssh username@yourdomain
```

You should be able to login without any password requests. _Only_ if this works
should you proceed with the following: Edit the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file
again and add:

```
PasswordAuthentication no
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
```

This will disable password logins and only allow key based authentication.

## Changing Port

This is an optional step but it's also a very easy way to stop the standard
script kiddies from port scanning your server and detecting that SSH is
enabled. By changing the default port of 22 to something uncommon the number of
attacks that you'll see will most likeley drop significantly. Just change the
line `Port 22` to something else:

```
Port xxxx
```

## Webmin

Webmin is a web based administrative tool for Linux/Unix based servers. It
allows you to manage almost anything you could do from the command line from a
nice web interface.

First install webmin dependancies.

```sh
sudo apt-get install perl libnet-ssleay-perl openssl libauthen-pam-perl libpam-runtime libio-pty-perl libmd5-perl
```

Then download the latest webmin debian package:

```sh
wget -O webmin-current.deb http://www.webmin.com/download/deb/webmin-current.deb
```

Then use dpkg to install:

```sh
sudo dpkg -i webmin-current.deb
```

This will now allow you to go to `https://:10000`. You can login with the `root` account.

## Virtualmin

Virtualmin is a tool to manage multiple virtual servers. It makes managing
multiple websites on one server extremely easy.

First install ProFTPd.

```sh
sudo apt-get install proftpd
```

Then follow the instructions at `http://www.webmin.com/vdownload.html` to
install virtualmin. You may want to edit the default Virtual Host template
under Virtualmin > System Settings > Server Templates > Apache website
(Dropdown)

For example, I dislike the `www` in front of my domains so I added this to the
template:

```apacheconf
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www.${DOM} [NC]
RewriteRule ^/(.*)$ http://${DOM}/$1 [R=301]
```

I also added some log file locations

```apacheconf
ErrorLog ${HOME}/logs/error_log
CustomLog ${HOME}/logs/access_log combined
```

## Ruby on Rails

Now that the system is properly locked down we can move on to getting Rails
working. This will be a full setup of Rails, including how to deploy Rails apps
using Capistrano. Make sure you have followed the key authentication section
above, as that is required to get all this working.

First thing is to install ruby and some dependancies for RubyGems.

```sh
sudo apt-get install ruby build-essential libopenssl-ruby ruby1.8-dev
```

Next we have to install RubyGems. The recommended method of doing this is to
not use the package management system. Instead it's best to install it from
source. The latest version as of this article is 1.3.7.

```sh
wget http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/70696/rubygems-1.3.7.tgz
```

Extract and run the setup.rb

```sh
tar xvzf rubygems-1.3.7.tgz
cd rubygems-1.3.7
sudo ruby setup.rb
```

Once this is done you can delete the tgz and the rubygems-1.3.7 folder.
RubyGems installs the standard scripts with a `1.8` suffix. We'll have to
create symlinks:

```sh
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/gem1.8 /usr/local/bin/gem
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/ruby1.8 /usr/local/bin/ruby
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/rdoc1.8 /usr/local/bin/rdoc
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/ri1.8 /usr/local/bin/ri
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/irb1.8 /usr/local/bin/irb
```

Now we can install rails. On a VPS it's probably a good idea to not install
ri/rdoc. You may also want to include some other gems as needed.

```sh
sudo gem install rails --no-rdoc --no-ri
```

Next we can install the passenger gem. This is recommended over using apt-get
as the version available in apt is rather old.

```sh
sudo gem install passenger --no-rdoc --no-ri
```

After the gem is installed you'll have a new command available to compile the
passenger module for Apache2. Run:

```sh
sudo passenger-install-apache2-module
```

Follow the instructions that the install presents. There a number of
dependancies that are required. The installer will tell you which ones are
needed. Once this is done all that's left is to create virtual hosts for your
Rails apps.

Here is an example of a virtual host for a Rails app. The `DocumentRoot` should
point to the `public` directory of your Rails app. Passenger will then take
care of the rest.

```apacheconf
ServerName example.com

DocumentRoot /var/www/public
AllowOverride all
Options -MultiViews
LogLevel warn
```

So thats it for now. There are some other things I might add later on.
